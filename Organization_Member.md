# Authentication
The Authentication API enables you to manage all aspects of user identity when you use Auth. It offers endpoints so your users can log in, log out, access APIs, and more.

## **BearerAuth**
The authorization token for this account. It's gives access to the bearer. This token should be kept a secret, so no sharing. Its expires in 24hours.

| ----------- | ----------- |
| Security Scheme Type | HTTP |
| HTTP Authorization Scheme | bearer|
| Bearer format | "JWT"|
|  |  |
## **CookieAuth**
It authorizes clients request and maintains session information. Its expires in 24hours.

|  |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |

## **Errors**
When an error occurs, you will receive an error object. Most of these error objects contain an error code and an error description so that your applications can more efficiently identify the problem.

If you get a 4xx response code, then you can assume that there is a bad request from your end. In this case, 
check the [Standard Error Responses](#standard-error-responses) for more context.

5xx errors suggest a problem on server's end.
